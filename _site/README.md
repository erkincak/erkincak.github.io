# My GitHub Pages Jekyll Site

This is a simple Jekyll website created for GitHub Pages with 5 pages: Home, About, Blog, Projects, and Contact.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Ruby and Bundler if not already installed.

2. Install dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

3. Build and serve the site locally:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000` to view the site.

## Deployment

Push all source files (including this README, Gemfile, \_config.yml, and markdown pages) to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.

GitHub Pages will automatically build and publish the site.
